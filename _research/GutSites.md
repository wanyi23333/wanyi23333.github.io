For most primates including Japanese macaques, microbial fermentation takes place at the colon. However, microbes form complex community not only in the colonic region, but also in other digestive organs. In this project, I compared the microbial composition and function at the stomach and colon of wild Japanese macaques. It is hypothesized that the microbial communities diversify with the physiochemical environment, while supporting digestive role of the respective organs, i.e., chemical digestion at stomach and microbial fermentation at the colon.
