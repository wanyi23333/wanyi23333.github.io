Living at the northern limits of the primate global range, Japanese macaques inhabit the temperate forest- the marginal habitat for the primates. Due to the seasonality and low fruit production in the temperate forests, Japanese macaques rely considerably on the low-quality foods. Considering their dependence on fibrous foods relative to the tropical primates, Japanese macaques and their gut microbiome may have co-evolved along with the macaques’ expansion across the Japanese archipelago. In this project, I examined and compared the gut microbiome of 19 macaque populations, aiming to clarify the relative role of host genetics, geography, and diet (forest type, season and reliance on anthropogenic foods) in shaping the macaque gut microbiome.

> <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
> In recent decades, human–wildlife interaction and associated anthropogenic food provisioning has been increasing and becoming more severe due to fast population growth and urban development. Noting the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology like nutrition and health, it is thus essential to understand how human–wildlife interactions and availability of anthropogenic food in habitats can affect an animal's gut microbiome. This study, therefore, set out to examine the gut microbiota of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) with varying accessibility to anthropogenic food and the possibility of using gut microbiota as indicator for macaques’ reliance on anthropogenic food. Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we described the microbial composition of Japanese macaques experiencing different types of human disturbance and anthropogenic food availability—captive, provisioned, crop-raiding, and wild. In terms of alpha diversity, our results showed that observed richness of gut microbiota did not differ significantly between disturbance types but among collection sites, whereas Shannon diversity index differed by both disturbance types and sites. In terms of beta diversity, captive populations harbored the most distinctive gut microbial composition, and had the greatest difference compared with wild populations. Whereas for provisioned and crop-raiding groups, the macaques exhibited intermediate microbiota between wild and captive. We identified several potential bacterial taxa at different taxonomic ranks whose abundance potentially could help in assessing macaques’ accessibility to anthropogenic food. This study revealed the flexibility of the gut microbiome of Japanese macaques and provided possible indices based on the gut microbiome profile in assessing macaques’ accessibility to/reliance on anthropogenic foods.
