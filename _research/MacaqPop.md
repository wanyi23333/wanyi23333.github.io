Living at the northern limits of the primate global range, Japanese macaques inhabit the temperate forest- the marginal habitat for the primates. Due to the seasonality and low fruit production in the temperate forests, Japanese macaques rely considerably on the low-quality foods. Considering their dependence on fibrous foods relative to the tropical primates, Japanese macaques and their gut microbiome may have co-evolved along with the macaques’ expansion across the Japanese archipelago. In this project, I examined and compared the gut microbiome of 19 macaque populations, aiming to clarify the relative role of host genetics, geography, and diet (forest type, season and reliance on anthropogenic foods) in shaping the macaque gut microbiome.
