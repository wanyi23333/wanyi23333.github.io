To link the exact diet intake, gut microbiome composition and fermentative ability, this project examined the seasonal variation in the gut microbiome of Japanese macaques. In addition to the year-round behavioral observation and meta-16s rRNA analysis, I directly measured the fermentative ability by simulating the fermentation process through in vitro fermentation assay. To do so, fresh feces of Japanese macaques were collected monthly, then fermented with leaf powder (representative of high fiber food) or monkey pellet (representative of low fiber food) for 24 hours.
